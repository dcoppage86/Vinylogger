From the ringing feedback to the overdriven guitar and bass, I was sucked in and forever indebted to this album...forever", image: "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71F%2BHUcCF0L._SY355_.jpg")
album = Album.create(title: 'Hold Me Up', artist: 'Goo Goo Dolls', release_date: 1990, description: "Most people remember this band just being so mainstream and radio friendly, little do they know that their humble beginnings paid homage to the greats such as, The Clash, The Replacements, Husker Du, etc. This record still gives me the same excitement I when I was 12 years old, I felt like such a rebel.", image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4d/Ggdholdme.png/220px-Ggdholdme.png")
album = Album.create(title: 'Damaged', artist: 'Black Flag', release_date: 1981, description: "Talk about a powerhouse of punkrock and hardcore. They set the line for many bands to follow, and god did they. Black flag were superheros of the genre and gave us everything we needed from aggressive music. This record was honest, raw, riot inducing madness. It was and still is a soundtrack for the unheard, the unloved, and underappreciated.", image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/00/Black_Flag_-_Damaged_cover.jpg")
